This is RPM Dick, who was graduated at xxx scholl, and join HSBC as well as RPM team since 2008.
Now I'm experienced in RPM Basel system, also has solid technical knowledge on Datastage/Shell/SAS/Python/DB2/Mainframe.

In the past, I worked as a developer and support for the new project(CNF, GBF) and PPCR in early years. And begin to take lead role in Project (MYH model redevelopment), PPCR and Ever green project (i.e datastage upgrade).

Currently I work as a Technecal lead in IFRS9 project and provide technecal support to the team expeciall the Xi'an so that we can delivery the project on a tightly schedule. In the mean time, I'm the DevOps lead in RPM, and target to steamline our development process and automate the testing/deploy by making the DevOps tools or self developed tools.

My career goals for next few years is to become the architecture lead of RPM team.  By archieveing this, I will take responsibility to try the new technology such as big data or cloud and I will lead the team to review or revamp the existing system(datastage) so that it can migrate to the new technology (i.e. Google data flow) easiliy.

 bring some new technology to the team like big data and cloud


During 9 year's working in RPM team, I've been participated in several projects, such as HASE CNF, AMH GBF and BCBS, also lots of PPCR and ever green projects. Which using Datastage/Shell/SAS/DB2/Mainframe as the major technology.  I get promtoed to current position(CS) in year 2016, and working on DevOps and IFRS9 project now.

As the new technology/methodology like big data/cloud/DevOps are very popular, and our Gary has a strong direction from our Risk team. So I think it's a good change for us to move forward to it instead of keep using the outdate technology (i.e. Datastage, single devlopment server).  And I'm willing to take part in these new changes, because I believe it will make us much simpler, better and faster.
